## Access the bot

### Personal
This is the easiest way to use the bot and the most appropriate for most users since it doesn't require any special knowledge. Just search for **@OpenCryptoBot** in Telegram (or click [here](https://telegram.me/OpenCryptoBot)) and you will find the bot.  

Once you found the bot, open a chat with him and press the *Start* button to access the bot. The bot will send you a list of all available commands that you can use. Click on a command to execute it or see which arguments you have to provide to get what you need.

### Group
It's also possible to add the bot to a Telegram group. Inside your group, in the upper right corner, open the menu and click on *Add Members* and then search for **@OpenCryptoBot**. Once you found the bot click on *Invite* and your done!

If you now want to use the bot inside that group, start typing `/` and you will see all available commands.

### Self-hosted
If you want to run the bot on your own for you personally or for a group, download the source code and run it locally on your own machine or on a server.  

For detailed instructions how to set the bot up, see details on [GitHub](https://github.com/Endogen/OpenCryptoBot).
