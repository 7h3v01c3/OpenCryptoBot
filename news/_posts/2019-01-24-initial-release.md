Today is the day. After about two months in the making, i'm proud to release the first version 0.1.0 of *OpenCryptoBot*!

This initial release should already have the basic set of commands and run quite well. If you encounter any bugs or want some much needed features, let me know. I would really be glad if anybody that comes across the bot would thoroughly test it so that i'm sure that no serious bugs are included.
